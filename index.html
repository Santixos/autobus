    <h1>Mean Autobus</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-style: italic;">
    You need to go to some place with the autobus number 5.
    But you don't know when it comes so you need to WAIT till it comes on the bus stop. <br/>  <br/> There are different autobuses coming randomly so you need to wait for every autobus and TAKE A SEAT only if its number is 5.
